# sna-pp
This repo contains some of my code for the preprocessing of survey data that will undergo social network analysis per CTSI internal objectives. The 'sna_ids' module uncovers the main 5 or so full-name structures in internal grant data through regex matching that enables correct matches with a central CTSI database since a unique key was missing from the raw per-researcher grant data. The 'matrices' module takes the uniquely keyed data and produces two-mode matrices that will be used to construct graphs representing the social network of URMC researchers and for further analysis of collaborative strengths over time.
